# My Weather App
This project is a **React + Vite Weather App** that fetches real-time weather data using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
It allows you to search any city, toggle temperature units between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and see the weather conditions in a clean, responsive UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies required for the project.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.  

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for caching purposes.  

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally so you can preview the final app before deploying.

### `npm run deploy` (Optional)

If you want to deploy the app to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy

This will build the app and push it to the gh-pages branch.

Note: Deployment is optional — the app can run locally without it.
